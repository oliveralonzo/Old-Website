      <h2 class="subHeadline"> Introduction </h2>
      <p class="text"> Immigration. Yes, that controversial topic that has been on the news lately. That system that is built to protect the U.S. All the “undocumented,” the “illegal,” the “bad hombres,” and else. It is a topic that has to be talked about. It is a situation for which a system that controls it should probably exist. It is a condition that creates different connotations. However, I believe that in so much talk, in such a systematic way of thinking, in so many terms used to refer to it there is one thing that might be forgotten: it is humans we are talking about. </p>

      <p class="text">  This project is intended to be a reminder of that last premise to anyone who reads it. To do this, I will provide three main points. The three should be helpful for anyone, but each will have a specific focus. First, I will show an important instance in which I have seen immigrants not being treated as humans, for the one who disagrees with me and thinks that they always are. Then, I will use geographical history to show an interesting connection between the history of territorial expansion of the U.S.  and its immigration density today. Lastly, I will provide one example, using the media, in which they at least are talking about the “undocumented” as “people.” </p>

      <p class="text"> I must say that even though the immigration issue involves many countries and nationalities, I will focus mainly on the Mexico-U.S. border because it rises some interesting observations and it is a topic that interests me (and also Mexicans make up 52% of the unauthorized immigrant population in the U.S., according to Pew Research Center). </p>

      <h2 class="subHeadline"> The Fence </h2>

      <p class="text"> I visited El Paso, Texas in October 2016 as part of a “Border Awareness Experience.” As I was standing in a current construction site, in which a 6-foot tall chain-link fence was being replaced by a two-layered 18-foot fence with big iron columns because of the Secure Fence Act (which stated that the fence would be 14-foot tall), I felt so ignorant for having criticized Mr. Trump’s statement “let’s build the wall.” I felt ignorant for criticizing it not because I don’t think his statement was wrong anymore, but because standing there made me realize how ignorant that statement is. I was seeing something being constructed that although it is being called a fence, I didn’t see much difference between that fence and a wall. </p>

      <p class="text"> What struck me the most about this experience was that one of the coordinators of the trip brought up a powerful contrast: “there are shorter fences at the zoo.” And that was the first time I noticed the way in which the system dehumanizes the people who are in this situation. Society blocks animals in a lighter way than these people are being blocked.  Shortly after that, I saw birds freely crossing the border fence. </p>

    <section class="body">
      <p class="text"> With this, I’m not saying that there should not be a tall border. I’m not even trying to imply that there should not be a border. Those things I don’t know and it would take a lot of research for me to figure it out. Instead, I’m just posing the question  “why do we have shorter fences at the zoo?” as something to think about. </p>

      <h2 class="subHeadline"> The Ancestors' Land </h2>

      <p class="text"> Now, let us talk a tiny bit about history. This isn’t supposed to be a thorough historic account, but a look at American history that shows an interesting connection between the expansion of the U.S. and today’s immigration density. To do this, we must back up a couple of hundred years to the territorial expansion of the U.S. To clarify, I’m not saying that the expansion was good or wrong. I’m not a historian so I don’t know that. And it is certainly something that happened in many places during the colonial times. It happened where I’m from (the Dominican Republic) when Haiti conquered the whole island in 1822 and again when Dominicans claimed the east side back in 1844, being just a tiny island. No wonder it would happen in the big land that constitutes the U.S. Thus, let us look at the territorial expansion of the mainland, which happened from independence to 1853, with this interactive map. </p>

    <section class="body">
      <p class="text"> Now, let us look at today’s immigration density. Based on the <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/interactives/unauthorized-immigrants/" target="_blank"> data collected by the Pew Research Center in 2014 </a>, California has the highest density, with about 2.3 million, followed by Texas, with about 1.6 million. Next in the list is Florida, with 850,000. At the bottom of the list are states like Maine, Montana, the Dakotas, Vermont and Wyoming, with less than 5,000. </p>

      <div class="imageBox">
        <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/Unauthorizedimmigrationmap/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes" target="_blank"> <img src="imgs/density.png" alt="density map"> </a>
      </div>

      <p class="text">Thus, if we back up to 1835, we can see an interesting connection. Nearly 4.5 million people, which would account for about 40% of the total immigrant population <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/03/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank"> (11.1 million according to Pew Research Center) </a>, is located in the stretch that less than 200 years ago belonged to Mexico, their ancestors’ land. </p>

      <div class="imageBox">
        <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/Unauthorizedimmigrationmap/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes" target="_blank"> <img src="imgs/density-with-border.png" alt="density map with 1836 border"> </a>
      </div>

      <p class="text">Furthermore, what is interesting is that part of the Treaty of Guadalupe (which granted the part of Mexico land that now belongs to the U.S.) was that the Mexican habitants of that land could choose if they wanted to become U.S. citizens or not. About 90% chose to become U.S. citizens. Granted that back then we’re only talking about 80,000, not the 11 million from today. But the Treaty of Guadalupe also established that the U.S. paid only $15 million, which would be around $410 million today and I’m sure that land is worth way more than $410 million today, thus proportions are not at stake. But this is where the interesting question comes: why when there was a clear tangible benefit to the U.S. as the land it was so easy to grant them citizenship? Should we use humans to our benefit just like that? </p>

      <p class="text">This is not to say that the land should be given back, nor that the U.S. should grant citizenship to every immigrant on an illegal status, again, I do not know if it should be that way or not. But it poses interesting questions. </p>

      <h2 class="subHeadline"> The Media </h2>

      <p class="text"> Now, let's look at a group of people who kind of got it right (i.e. that it is humans what immigration is about) during my research. On Nov. 16 and 17, 2016 I gathered 200 media articles, mainly newspapers, that showed up after a Google search for both “undocumented immigrants” and “immigration.” This included media outlets from newspapers The New York Times, LA Times to CNN, ABC and NBC News. Then, I performed a text analysis based on word frequencies to see which words had been used the most in these articles. After deleting “undocumented immigrants” and “immigration” from the most frequent words, for those were the search terms and of thus would show up in every article, I found that “people” was the third most popular term. </p>

      <div class="imageBox">
        <a href="http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=2d9fb5b74a54f10538686af3d235250a&stopList=keywords-c461ed63258ee7c642aa6b003de67ec2&whiteList=&view=Cirrus" target="_blank">
        <img src="imgs/media.png" alt="">
      </a>
      </div>

      <p class="text"> However, this still showed something that concerns me a little bit. “Trump” and “border” were still used more often than “people,” which shows what I said in the introduction. The topic usually turns into political talk or talk about the system. But, as I said, even though all the other terms (undocumented, immigrants, illegals and even criminals) showed up among the most frequent, at least they are being portrayed as “people” by some. </p>

      <p class="text"> One last thing, it is good to remember that “undocumented” can be a little deceiving as a term and only applies in the context of their situation in the U.S., for most of these people have their documents in the countries they are coming from. They’re not “aliens” coming from other planet, they are people coming from countries in which documents exist too. </p>

      <h2 class="subHeadline"> Conclusion? </h2>

      <p class="text"> If you have made it this far, you probably have a good idea of what my conclusion is. I don’t have a conclusion. The more I think about and consider this issue, the further I feel from drawing conclusions. I am only left with questions, some of which I have given to you. </p>

      <p class="text"> It is a complicated issue and this is just a tiny aspect of the vast number of things that go into it, from both sides of the issue. I invite you to explore deeper into the topic and draw some conclusions for yourself. And even though my project focused on Mexicans who are on an illegal status in the U.S. to illustrate the issue, I invite you to explore other nationalities both in the U.S. and in other countries. As I said, my hope with this project is that when you do so if you do, before drawing your conclusions, remember that it is humans we’re talking about. </p>
