        <p class="text"> This was done by me, Oliver Alonzo! This is my final project for my Introduction to Digital Humanities class at Creighton University during the fall semester of 2016. My intention wasn’t for it to be a research paper or anything like that, but I wanted it to read as an opinion article in a newspaper, or a letter to a friend. </p>

        <p class="text">The assignment for the project indicated to choose any topic of my interest. I chose immigration because, as I mentioned in the project, I went down to El Paso, Texas as a part of a service and justice trip through the Schlegel Center for Service and Justice. </p>

        <p class="text"> In class, we learned the history of the Digital Humanities and many of the technologies used in the field, which our professor described in the syllabus as a “burgeoning interdisciplinary field.” We learned how to use tools that included, as the syllabus says, “geographic and mapping tools, text and image analysis, website design and digital archives, social networking and network analysis, and historically-based gaming.” I chose to use the first three. Most of the tools we used weren’t too visually appealing for my taste and thus I decided to make my own designs based on the data that I obtained from the tools learned in class. To learn more about those tools, go to the credits page. </p>

          Once I had outlined my project and had a clear idea of where I wanted to go with it, I started exploring which tools of the ones we learned in class would be the most benefitial. I ended up using the ones I mentioned above, but as I said, I wanted to make them a little more visually pleasing. To do that, I used Illustrator a lot, as well as HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          The interactive map was done by me, piece by piece, on Illustrator. The idea of doing a timeline came from a tool we learned in class that <a href="http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/neatline/"> omeka.org offers called Neatline. </a> However, I decided to design my own map and make it transition using javascript, with a slider. I coded the slider so that it switches pictures every time the slider reached a year in which an event happened, as well as the description.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          I also used Illustrator to make images of the other visualizations (the densities map and the text-mining). The pictures link to the actual Tableau and Voyant-Tools projects, respectively. What I did for the map was using the eyedropper tool in Illustrator to obtain the right color for each state. For the text-mining visualization, I downloaded the .svg file from Voyant-Tools and, using Illustrator, changed it to a font and a color that fitted my project better.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          Lastly, I used HTML and CSS to create the website, from scratch.
